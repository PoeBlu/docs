## Requirements

DADI API is built on Node.js and is backed by a MongoDB database.

The DADI platform follows the Node.js LTS (Long Term Support) release schedule, and as such the version of Node.js required to run DADI API is coupled to the version currently in Active LTS. See the [LTS schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/LTS) for further information.

**Current Recommended Versions**

* **Node.js:** 4.6.0
* **MongoDB:** 3.0

## Configuration

Configuration files control the behaviour of your API. While DADI API starts with default values for many configuration settings, it is essential that you understand how each setting affects your application.

See [Configuration](./configuration) for detailed documentation of configuration options in DADI API.
