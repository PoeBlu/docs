# Contributing

You are encouraged to help improve the quality of this guide for the benefit of our team and the community at large. Products are made stronger by good documentation and a good developer is a good documenter 😇

Please contribute if you see any typos or factual errors or gaps in the knowledge-base. You may also find incomplete content or stuff that is not up to date. Make updates by sending a pull request to master, or file an issue for stuff you cannot patch yourself.

If you're looking to contribute to core development, get started by reading our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) section.
