# DADI Track

## Overview

DADI Track is a real time data visualisation layer built around the concept of events. It makes use of Node's non-blocking architecture to present a 1:1 view of tracked activity within a platform.

Events can be sent to DADI Track from a client device or from within the Bantam stack.

DADI Track is deliberately lightweight: it is not intended as a long term data storage solution or as a replacement to existing tracking tools such as Google Analytics or the wider DADI+ platform; rather it is designed to facilitate real time data dash boarding.
