## h: Image height

The height of the required output image, in pixels.

If only `h` is specified, the `w (width)` dimension will be _set to the width of the original image_. If you'd like to ensure the output image retains the aspect ratio of the original image, please ensure `resize=aspectfit` is specified.

If both width and height are omitted, the original imageâ€™s dimensions are used.

> **Security Note:** The maximum output image size can be specified in the configuration file.

The `security` setting allows you to set a maximum width and height for generated images. This prevents the potential for a DOS attack based on the repeated generation of large images which could push your platform offline by exhausting CPU and/or available memory.

You should set this to the maximum size required for images in your application.

```js
"security": {
  "maxWidth": 2048,
  "maxHeight": 1024
}
```
