## Overview

DADI Passport is a library for generating access tokens to authenticate with DADI platform components.

Various components within the DADI stack implement 2-legged oAuth2, requiring a bearer token to authorise requests. This bearer token is obtained as a response sent to a specific endpoint with a clientId/secret pair, along with a TTL defined by the provider.

This library can be used by third-party applications that wish to integrate with DADI, as it abstracts the oAuth protocol by storing and requesting bearer tokens as needed, and returning always a promise with a valid bearer token.
